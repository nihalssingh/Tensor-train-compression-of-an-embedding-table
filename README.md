# Tensor-train-compression-of-an-embedding-table

Place any embedding table .mat file in the same directory prior to running the code. To test out functionality, a sample embedding table A has been commented and placed on line 4.
Final plot shows the compression ratio for different error bounds when using Tensor Train Decomposition
